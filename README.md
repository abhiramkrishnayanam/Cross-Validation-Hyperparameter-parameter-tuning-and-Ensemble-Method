# Classification Task with Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Ensemble Methods

## Project Overview
This project involves building a classification model using a synthetic dataset to predict binary class labels. The main objectives of this project were to:
1. Perform **Cross-Validation** to evaluate model performance.
2. Implement **Hyperparameter Tuning** to optimize model parameters.
3. Apply **Ensemble Methods** to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a synthetic dataset generated using the `make_classification` function from `sklearn.datasets`. It contains:
- **1000 samples**
- **10 features** (5 informative and 2 redundant)
- A **binary target variable**.

## Techniques and Methods

### 1. Cross-Validation
Cross-validation was performed to:
- Evaluate the model's performance across different folds of data.
- Ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.
  
**Implementation:**
- Used `StratifiedKFold` to maintain class distribution across folds.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was used to improve the model's performance by finding the optimal set of hyperparameters.

**Approach:**
- **GridSearchCV**: Exhaustive search over a predefined grid of hyperparameters.
- Target Model: Logistic Regression
- Tuned Parameters:
  - `C`: Regularization strength
  - `penalty`: Regularization type (L1, L2)
  - `solver`: Optimization algorithm
  
**Outcome:**
- Identified the best combination of hyperparameters for the Logistic Regression model.

### 3. Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods were applied to further improve the model's robustness and accuracy.

#### Methods Used:
1. **Bagging with Random Forest**
   - Combined predictions from multiple decision trees trained on bootstrapped datasets.
   - Reduced variance and improved generalization.

2. **Boosting with Gradient Boosting**
   - Sequentially trained models to correct errors from previous iterations.
   - Enhanced model accuracy and reduced bias.

3. **Stacking**
   - Combined predictions from multiple base models (Random Forest, SVM) using Logistic Regression as a meta-model.
   - Leveraged diverse models for better performance.

4. **Voting**
   - Combined predictions from multiple models using hard voting (majority class) and soft voting (average probabilities).

## Results
- **Cross-Validation Performance**:
  - Ensured consistent accuracy across different data splits.
- **Best Tuned Model**:
  - Logistic Regression with optimal hyperparameters.
- **Ensemble Performance**:
  - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed high accuracy and robustness.
  - Stacking and Voting provided slightly improved results by combining model predictions.
